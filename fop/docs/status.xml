      <title>Development Status</title>

	  <p>The FOP code base is gradually evolving, from version 0.90
	  released on 22 November 2005, to version 1.0 released in July
	  2010. Further releases in the 1.x series may be expected.</p>
      <p>FOP releases before version 0.90 were based on a different
	  code base. The last release in that series was version 0.20.5,
	  released on 18 July 2003. This series is no longer maintained.</p>
      <p>
        If you're looking for a long-term road-map we have to disappoint you. This is Open
        Source and we're mostly volunteers working in their free time. What we have
        is an idea where we want to go. How fast we get there depends on the 
        available time, on how well our ideas work out while developing and on you!
        There's a <link href="http://wiki.apache.org/xmlgraphics-fop/RoadMap">document in the Wiki</link>
        where ideas for new developments may be registered and documented.
