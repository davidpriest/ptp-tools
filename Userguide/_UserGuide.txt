== Welcome to Plain Text Publishing

xPT provides a (nearly) self-supported plain text to PDF, ePub, and HTML
publication system.

Installation requires:

* pre-installation of Java
* pre-installation of Python
* creating a work directory
* copying ptp-tools to the work directory
* copying ptp-tools/template to the work directory
* using a plain text editor to tell the toolset where it is

You can then rename the template to that of the documentation youâ€™ll be
creating and go to town.

To publish, open a terminal at the documentation directory and run
mk_bash.sh or mk_win.bat.  The results will be in the `output` directory.
