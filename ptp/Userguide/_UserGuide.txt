== Welcome to Plain Text Publishing!

ptp-tools combines a plain text markup translator with a industry-standard
open source publishing toolset that generates professional-quality PDF, ePub,
and XHTML final documents. Pre-publication transformation and publication
layout and style are fully customizable, supporting both a corporate standard
style and customizations of that style for each document.

ptp-tools comprises:

* ASCIIDoc, a plain text markup processing system.

* Docbook XML and the Stayton XSL:FO transformations.

* Apache FOP, an XSL:FO to PDF rendering engine.

* ptp-tools/ptp, a set of Bash and Windows scripts guiding the
  transformation pipeline.

* xsltproc, an XSLT interpreter (needed by Windows platforms).

* XMLSh, a POSIX-flavoured "Bash plus XML" scripting interpreter.

ptp-tools requires pre-installation of:

* Python.

* Java.


== Installation

Download or clone ptp-tools to your document library directory. Open
`ptp-tools` and run `install.sh` or `install.bat`. The required open source
components will be downloaded and installed in the same directory as the
installation script.

To start you off with creating new documents, you can copy `ptp/_TEMPLATE` to
your document library directory. `_TEMPLATE` includes the publishing scripts,
stub entries for customizing ASCIIDoc and XSL processing, a sample document,
and a sample docinfo.


== Library Structure

Each publication is maintained in a separate directory containing the source
text, source images, configuration and transformation customizations, and a
publication script.

The publication script (`publish.sh` or `publish.bat`) attempts to find the
publication tools in either a sibling directory or subdirectory of the
publication directory. 

The tools are expected to be in a directory named `ptp-tools`.  If you 
cloned to a different directory, you will need to set the PTP_TOOLS 
environment variable or modify your `publish.sh` or `publish.bat` file.
