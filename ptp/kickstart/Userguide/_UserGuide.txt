== Welcome to Plain Text Publishing

The PTP package combines a plain text markup translator with a
industry-standard open-source publishing toolset that generates PDF, XHTML,
and ePub editions of the source plaintext. Pre-publication transformation and
publication layout and style are fully customizable, supporting both a
corporate standard style and customizations of that style for each document.

The PTP toolset comprises:

* ASCIIDoc, a plain text markup processing system.

* Docbook XML and the Stayton XSL:FO transformations.

* Apache FOP, an XSL:FO to PDF rendering engine.

* ptp-tools/ptp, a set of Bash and Windows scripts guiding the
  transformation pipeline.

* xsltproc, an XSLT interpreter (needed by Windows platforms).

* XMLSh, a POSIX-flavoured "Bash plus XML" scripting interpreter.

The PTP toolset requires installation of:

* Python.

* Java.


== Publication Structure

Each publication is maintained in a separate directory containing the source
text, source images, configuration and transformation customizations, and a
publication script.

The publication script (`publish.sh` or `publish.bat`) attempts to find the
publication tools in either a sibling directory or subdirectory of the
publication directory. 

The tools are expected to be in a directory named `ptp-tools`.  If you 
cloned to a different directory, you will need to set the PTP_TOOLS 
environment variable or modify your `publish.sh` or `publish.bat` file.
